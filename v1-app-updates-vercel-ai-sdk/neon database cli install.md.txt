# 1. Install Vercel Blob as a dependency
pnpm install @vercel/blob

# 2. Initialize Blob storage (this will guide you through setup)
npx @vercel/blob init

# 3. This command will:
# - Create necessary configuration
# - Add Blob-related environment variables to your Vercel project
# - Prompt you through the setup process

# 4. After initialization, deploy to Vercel to ensure environment variables are set
vercel
```

Detailed Steps:
1. Neon Database:
- Creates a PostgreSQL database
- Generates a secure connection string
- You'll use this connection string in your Vercel environment variables

2. Vercel Blob:
- Allows storing files like images, PDFs, etc.
- Provides a simple API for uploading and retrieving files
- Integrates directly with Vercel deployments

After these steps, you'll:
- Have a Neon database connection string
- Have Vercel Blob configured
- Be ready to add these to your Vercel environment variables
